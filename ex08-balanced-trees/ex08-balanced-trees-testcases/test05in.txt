I Certainly not just water but the word of God in and with the water 
E does these things along with the faith which trusts this word of God in 
I the water For without Gods word the water is plain water and no 
E Baptism But with the word of God it is a Baptism that is a lifegiving 
I water rich in grace and a washing of the new birth in the Holy Spirit
E as St Paul says in Titus chapter three He saved us through the 
I washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit whom He poured 
E out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior so that having 
I been justified by His grace we might become heirs having the hope of
E eternal life This is a trustworthy saying
